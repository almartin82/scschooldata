\section{Data Sources}{

The package uses two primary data sources:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Active Student Headcounts} (ed.sc.gov): The primary source,
providing school and district-level enrollment by grade and demographics.
Available from 2012-13 school year onwards.
\item \strong{SC Report Cards} (screportcards.com): Secondary source with
comprehensive school information. Available from 2017-18 school year onwards.
}
}

\section{Main Functions}{

\describe{
\item{\code{\link{fetch_enr}}}{Download and process enrollment data for a single year}
\item{\code{\link{fetch_enr_multi}}}{Download enrollment data for multiple years}
\item{\code{\link{tidy_enr}}}{Convert wide enrollment data to long format}
\item{\code{\link{get_available_years}}}{List available data years}
